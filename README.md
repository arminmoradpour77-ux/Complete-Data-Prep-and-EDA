Complete Data Prep & EDA Project

Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a full end-to-end workflow for data preparation (cleaning, feature engineering) and exploratory data analysis (EDA). 
The goal is to show how to preprocess raw data, detect and handle data quality issues, and extract insights through visualization and summary statistics.

Key objectives:
Clean and preprocess raw data
Engineer features to improve data quality
Perform descriptive statistics and EDA
Visualize relationships, distributions, and trends
